# My cmd automation on startup

<p>Here, I have put together some regular actions in our personal computer which are required to clean regularly. Such as, clearing temporary files, recent files, prefetch data and many others.
There's no need to panic when or how to use it, to do all of this automatically in your computer, just execute the locate_startup_folder.bat and then copy and paste all the files that you want to execute regularly and automatically.</p>

<p>Feel free to contribute, suggest or provide feedback in this project, wheather it's CMD or Batch file or any other language.</p>
